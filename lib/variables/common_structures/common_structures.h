     * From TS38.331 6.2.2
     * cellBarred: barred means the cell is barred, as defined in TS 38.304 [20].
     * dmrs-TypeA-Position: Position of (first) DM-RS for downlink (see 38.211, section 7.4.1.1.1) and uplink (see 38.211, section 6.4.1.1.3).
     * intraFreqReselection: Controls cell selection/reselection to intra-frequency cells when the highest ranked cell is barred, or treated as barred by the UE, as specified in TS 38.304 [20}.
     * pdcch-ConfigSIB1: See TS 38.213 [13]. Determines a common ControlResourceSet (CORESET) a common search space and necessary PDCCH parameters. If the field ssb-SubcarrierOffset indicates that SIB1 is not present, the field pdcch-ConfigSIB1 indicate the frequency positions where the UE may find SS/PBCH block with SIB1 or the frequency range where the network does not provide SS/PBCH block with SIB1 (see TS 38.213 [13], section 13).
     * ssb-SubcarrierOffset: Corresponds to kSSB (see TS 38.213 [13]), which is the frequency domain offset between SSB and the overall resource block grid in number of subcarriers. (See 38.211).
     * The value range of this field may be extended by an additional most significant bit encoded within PBCH as specified in 38.213 [13].
     * This field may indicate that this beam does not provide SIB1 and that there is hence no common CORESET (see TS 38.213 [13], section 13). In this case, the field pdcch- ConfigSIB1 may indicate the frequency positions where the UE may (not) find a SS/PBCH with a control resource set and search space for SIB1 (see 38.213 [13], section 13).
     * subCarrierSpacingCommon: Subcarrier spacing for SIB1, Msg.2/4 for initial access and broadcast SI-messages. If the UE acquires this MIB on a carrier frequency <6GHz, the value scs15or60 corresponds to 15 Khz and the value scs30or120 corresponds to 30 kHz. If the UE acquires this MIB on a carrier frequency >6GHz, the value scs15or60 corresponds to 60 Khz and the value scs30or120 corresponds to 120 kHz.
     * systemFrameNumber: The 6 most significant bit (MSB) of the 10-bit System Frame Number. The 4 LSB of the SFN are conveyed in the PBCH transport block as part of transport_channel coding (i.e. outside the MIB encoding).
